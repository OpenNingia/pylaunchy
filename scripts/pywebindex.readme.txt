About
========
PyWebIndex is a Launchy python plugin that allows quick access to links from index pages.

It is intended for software developers wishing to access automatically generated SDK documentation such as Doxygen, although you might other find forms of use as well.

The user can define a list of keywords (called "Name") and associate them with index pages (called "Index URL"). Later on, user can access each of the links from the index pages by using the defined keyboard.

For example, the following pages might be used with this plugin:
 * http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/classes.html
 * http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/libs/python/doc/v2/reference.html
 
The plugin indexes the links in advance, meaning you should have fast access when they are needed.
