Requirements
-------------------------
The following are needed for building PyLaunchy:
 * Qt 4.6 (or any QT version compatible with Launchy)
 * Python 2.3 and above (compatible with Boost.Python)
 * Boost 1.35 and above
 * PyQt4, for the chosen Qt and Python versions
 * CMake 2.6 and above

Building on Windows
-------------------------
 * Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2005 are required.
 * The Windows build directory is src\windows.
 * Copy the "set_environment.bat.example" file to "set_environment.bat" and modify it.
 * Run the "run_cmake.bat" script to prepare the build environment.
 * To build, run "dev.bat" script.

Building on Linux
-------------------------
* Install all development packages for the libraries from above
* mkdir src/linux ; cd src/linux ; cmake ../ ; make
* The build process generates a lot of warnings, due to incompatibility with the "ezlogger" library source code
* Tested on Ubuntu Linux 10.04

Installation on Linux
-------------------------
* After building, copy the libPyLaunchy.so file from src/linux/pylaunchy to /usr/lib/launchy/plugins
* The "plugins" directory should be copied to /usr/lib/launchy/plugins/python
* Another option would be to put the "plugins" directory in the user home 
  directory (e.g ~), modify the ~/launchy.ini file and change the "scriptsDir"
  value to /home/user/my_launchy_plugins_dir
