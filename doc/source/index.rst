PyLaunchy: Python plugins for Launchy
========================================

Welcome to PyLaunchy
-----------------------

**PyLaunchy** is an extension to Launchy_'s plugin system, that allows a user
to develop Launchy plugins in the Python_ programming language.

PyLaunchy features:

Launchy plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
PyLaunchy comes with some powerful Launchy plugins: 

* :ref:`pygoy`
* :ref:`pydiry`
* :ref:`pywebindex`

Simple plugin development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Launchy_ has a C++ API for developing extension plugins, which can be 
developed in order to add new types of objects to the catalog, rather than 
just files. 

However, using C++ to develop plugins, even with QT, can be difficult and 
tedious. This is where PyLaunchy comes to assist. In one hand, you have the 
simplicity of a scripting launguage, and on the other hand you have the power 
of the Python_ programming language.
