Installing pylaunchy
=====================

pylaunchy can be installed in several ways:
1. Using an installer
2. Using a binary package
3. Using a source package

Requirements
--------------
 * Download and install Python 2.5 from `www.python.org <http://www.python.org>`_ .
 * Make sure you have Launchy 2.1.2

Using the installer (PyLaunchy-|version|.exe)
----------------------------------------------
Download the latest setup file from the Downloads page, then run it and follow
the instructions.

**Note:** 
The installer only unpacks the files in the Launchy directory and creates
an uninstaller. You can use the binary ZIP file if you encouter any problems
during the installation (permissions, for example).

Using the binary package (PyLaunchy-bin-|version|.zip)
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Download the latest binary package from the downloads page.
2. Unpack the ZIP file in the **root** Launchy directory. For example, if
   Launchy was installed in ``C:\Program Files\Launchy``, unpack the ZIP
   file in ``C:\Program Files\Launchy``.
3. After unpacking, the *boost_python-vc80-mt-1_35.dll* file should in the
   same directory as *Launchy.exe*.
   
Using the source package (PyLaunchy-src-|version|.zip)
-------------------------------------------------------
Work in progress. In the meantime, read the Building.txt file in the ZIP file.
